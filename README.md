# E-Commerce Transaction Fraud Detection
## Overview
In this competition, youâ€™ll benchmark machine learning models on a challenging large-scale dataset. The data comes from Vesta's real-world e-commerce transactions and contains a wide range of features from device type to product features. You also have the opportunity to create new features to improve your results.

## Data

# <h3>**Transaction Table**<h3>
**TransactionDT:** timedelta from a given reference datetime (not an actual timestamp)  
**TransactionAMT:** transaction payment amount in USD  
**ProductCD:** product code, the product for each transaction  
**card1 - card6:** payment card information, such as card type, card category, issue bank, country, etc.  
**addr:** address  
**dist:** distance  
**P_ and (R__) emaildomain:** purchaser and recipient email domain  
**C1-C14:** counting, such as how many addresses are found to be associated with the payment card, etc. The actual meaning is masked.  
**D1-D15:** timedelta, such as days between previous transaction, etc.  
**M1-M9:** match, such as names on card and address, etc.  
**Vxxx:** Vesta engineered rich features, including ranking, counting, and other entity relations.    
  

# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Three models trained to label anonymized credit card transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud). Project through [ML@B](https://ml.berkeley.edu).
